# OpenCV
Uses haarcascade tables to have facial recognition features. This script utilises a raspberry pi's camera module and then displays the video stream with rectangles around the faces. Currently works up to around 10fps at 320x240p but fps can be improved for a bespoke usage scenario.
Script can be boosted up to 18fps with VNC off and even up to 480x320p but results may vary.
